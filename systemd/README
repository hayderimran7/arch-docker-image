I was inspired by: https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/codekoala/ssh

To run: 
docker run --privileged -v /sys/fs/cgroup:/sys/fs/cgroup:ro -p 2222:22 michaelneale/arch_sshd_systemd

You may need to skip the ":ro" if it fails - as it needs to create a /sys/fs/cgroup/systemd if there isn't one on your host.

TODO:
Systemd needs cgroups - it is unpleasant in container. 
Runit would be better and not require priv mode either. 

Watch for  https://github.com/dotcloud/docker/pull/5773  - future docker version that may not need cgroup bound in. 
Also - no real need for sshd:  http://jpetazzo.github.io/2014/06/23/docker-ssh-considered-evil/
